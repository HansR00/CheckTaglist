This little program compares the Full list of Webtags on the Cumulus Wiki with the full list of WebTags as produced by CumulusMX. 

It runs in a directory where 'WebTags.txt' is present (so the CumulusMX directory would be a logical location). 
It fetches the wiki page from the internet and compares writing its output to 'TagsToDo.txt'

That's all folks.
